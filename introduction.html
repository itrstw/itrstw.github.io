<body>
The Industrial Technology Research Society, ITRS, is a technology hobbyist
group in Taiwan, whose members are mostly graduates or current students of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161106123203/http://www.hs.ntnu.edu.tw/">HSNU</a> (the Affilicated Senior High School of National Taiwan Normal University).<br>
<br>
It's an environment where motivated young students are free to explore their interest in science and technology and sometimes even get to implement their own ideas with help from senior members who now have years of professional experience or postgraduate academic training.<br>
<br>
Traditionally ITRS has four major departments:<ul>
<li>Electronics</li>
<li>Computer Science</li>
<li>Chemistry</li>
<li>Screen Printing</li>
</ul>
